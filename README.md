mongoose-migration
==================

Data migration tool for Mongoose

## Installation

Run the following command to install it:

```console
npm install mongoose-migration --save
```

## Usage

### Init configuration

The following command should be executed on the project root directory. It will create a configuration file with the given `config-file` name, or `.migrate.json` if not especified.

```console
migrate init [config-file]
```

With this you can have a configuration file for each environment, for example: `.migrate.dev.json` and `.migrate.prod.json`

After creating it you need to edit and add the path to your models.

Example:
```json
{
  "basepath": "migrations",
  "connection": "mongodb://localhost/db",
  "current_timestamp": 0,
  "models": {
    "User": "models/user.js"
  }
}
```

Note that on the previous example `models/user.js` is the model definition file. This file should exports the mongoose model definition.

`model/users.js` example:
```javascript
...
module.exports = mongoose.model('User', schema);
```

### Create a migration

```console
migrate create <description>
```

Example:
```console
migrate create "Add createdAt field to users collection"
```

### Edit Migration File

Open up your migration file (created on the previous step). It should have a default `up` and `down` function.

Example:
```javascript
exports.up = function(next) {
  next();
};

exports.down = function(next) {
  next();
};
```

Note: To load a mongoose model defined on your configuration file you should call `this.model(<model name>)`

Example:
```javascript
exports.up = function(next) {
  this
    .model('User')
    .update(
      {},
      {
        $set: { createdAt: Date.now() }
      },
      {
        multi: true,
        strict: false
      },
      function (error, numberAffected, raw) {
        if (error) {
          console.error(error);
        }
        console.log('The number of updated documents was %d', numberAffected);
        console.log('The raw response from Mongo was ', raw);
        next();
      }
    );
};

exports.down = function(next) {
  this
    .model('User')
    .update(
      {},
      {
        $unset: { createdAt: 1 }
      },
      {
        multi: true,
        strict: false
      },
      function (error, numberAffected, raw) {
        if (error) {
          console.error(error);
        }
        console.log('The number of updated documents was %d', numberAffected);
        console.log('The raw response from Mongo was ', raw);
        next();
      }
    );
};
```

### Perform Migration

```console
migrate
```
or
```console
migrate up [number of migrations to perform]
```
You can specify which configuration file should be loaded with `-c <file>` or `--config <file>` option. If it is not specified, `.migrate.json` will be used.
```console
migrate up [number of migrations to perform] -c .migrate.dev.json
```

Note: By default `migrate` will execute all migrations created until now. However `migrate up` will only execute one migration.

### Rollback Migration

```console
migrate down
```
or
```console
migrate down [number of migrations to rollback]
```
You can specify which configuration file should be loaded with `-c <file>` or `--config <file>` option. If it is not specified, `.migrate.json` will be used.
```console
migrate down [number of migrations to perform] -c .migrate.dev.json
```

### Help

```console
migrate -h
```

## Todo

- Add `migrate to [timestamp]`
- Add tests
